# benchmark-workers

Pre-written workflows and activities useful for benchmarking Temporal.

This worker can be used alongside Maru or other benchmarking tools to mimic different workloads.

Also included is a simple workflow runner which will keep a configurable number of workflow executions running concurrently to provide load for testing, starting a new execution each time one completes.

## Usage

### Worker

The worker is available as docker image for use in Docker or Kubernetes setups.

You can pull the latest image from: `ghcr.io/temporalio/benchmark-workers:main`.

In future we will provide releases with appropriate image tags to make benchmarks more easily repeatable.

The worker can be configured via environment variables. Currently only a small number of options are available, please let us know if there is a particular option you would like to be exposed by filing an issue.

The table below lists the environment variables available and the relevant Temporal Go SDK options they relate to (the worker is currently written using the Temporal Go SDK).

| Environment Variable | Relevant Client or Worker option | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TEMPORAL_GRPC_ENDPOINT | [ClientOptions.HostPort](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ClientOptions) | The Temporal Frontend GRPC endpoint |
| TEMPORAL_TLS_KEY | [ClientOptions.ConnectionOptions.TLS](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ConnectionOptions) | Path to TLS Key file |
| TEMPORAL_TLS_CERT | [ClientOptions.ConnectionOptions.TLS](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ConnectionOptions) | Path to TLS Cert file |
| TEMPORAL_TLS_CA | [ClientOptions.ConnectionOptions.TLS](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ConnectionOptions) | Path to TLS CA Cert file |
| TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE | [ClientOptions.Namespace](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ClientOptions) | The Temporal Namespace |
| TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE | [TaskQueue](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/worker#New) | The Temporal Task Queue |
| TEMPORAL_WORKFLOW_TASK_POLLERS | [WorkerOptions.MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPollers](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#WorkerOptions) | Number of workflow task pollers |
| TEMPORAL_ACTIVITY_TASK_POLLERS | [WorkerOptions.MaxConcurrentActivityTaskPollers](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#WorkerOptions) | Number of activity task pollers |
| PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT | n/a | The address to serve prometheus metrics on |

#### Kubernetes Deployment

There are several ways to deploy the worker in Kubernetes:

1. **Using kubectl run**:

```
kubectl run benchmark-worker --image ghcr.io/temporalio/benchmark-workers:main \
    --image-pull-policy Always \
    --env "TEMPORAL_GRPC_ENDPOINT=temporal-frontend.temporal:7233" \
    --env "TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE=default" \
    --env "TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE=benchmark" \
    --env "TEMPORAL_WORKFLOW_TASK_POLLERS=16" \
    --env "TEMPORAL_ACTIVITY_TASK_POLLERS=8"
```

2. **Using the example deployment YAML**:

We provide an [example deployment spec](./deployment.yaml) for you to customize to your requirements. Once you have edited the environment variables in the deployment.yaml you can create the deployment with `kubectl apply -f ./deployment.yaml`.

4. **Using the Helm chart (Recommended)**:

We provide a Helm chart that can be installed from the GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Install the chart
helm install benchmark-workers oci://ghcr.io/temporalio/charts/benchmark-workers
```

For more details and configuration options, see the [Helm chart documentation](./charts/benchmark-workers/README.md).

#### Prometheus Metrics

The worker can expose Prometheus metrics to help monitor the performance of your Temporal workers and cluster. To enable metrics:

1. **Using kubectl or deployment YAML**:
   ```
   --env "PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT=:9090"
   ```

2. **Using the Helm chart**:
   ```bash
   helm install benchmark-workers oci://ghcr.io/temporalio/charts/benchmark-workers \
     --set metrics.enabled=true
   ```

When using the Helm chart, it will automatically create a headless service for service discovery and can optionally create a ServiceMonitor resource for Prometheus Operator:

```bash
helm install benchmark-workers oci://ghcr.io/temporalio/charts/benchmark-workers \
  --set metrics.enabled=true \
  --set metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled=true
```

You can then use the benchmark workflows with your benchmark tool. To test with `tctl` you could run:

```
tctl workflow start --taskqueue benchmark --workflow_type ExecuteActivity --execution_timeout 60 -i '{"Count":1,"Activity":"Sleep","Input":{"SleepTimeInSeconds":3}}'
```

This will run the ExecuteActivity workflow, described below.

### Runner

The runner is a tool that starts a set number of workflows concurrently and as each workflow completes it will start another. This is useful for providing consistent load to your Temporal cluster. The runner will start and maintain exactly the number of workflows concurrently that you specified.

The runner can be configured via environment variables and command line arguments. Currently only a small number of options are available, please let us know if there is a particular option you would like to be exposed by filing an issue.

The table below lists the environment variables available and the relevant Temporal Go SDK options they relate to (the runner is currently written using the Temporal Go SDK).

| Environment Variable | Relevant Client or Worker option | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TEMPORAL_GRPC_ENDPOINT | [ClientOptions.HostPort](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ClientOptions) | The Temporal Frontend GRPC endpoint |
| TEMPORAL_TLS_KEY | [ClientOptions.ConnectionOptions.TLS.Certificates](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ConnectionOptions) | Path to TLS Key file |
| TEMPORAL_TLS_CERT | [ClientOptions.ConnectionOptions.TLS.Certificates](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ConnectionOptions) | Path to TLS Cert file |
| TEMPORAL_TLS_CA | [ClientOptions.ConnectionOptions.TLS](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.15.0/internal#ConnectionOptions) | Path to TLS CA Cert file |
| PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT | n/a | The address to serve prometheus metrics on |

The runner is also configured via command line options:

```
Usage: runner [flags] [workflow input] ...
  -c int
    	concurrent workflows (default 10)
  -n string
    	namespace (default "default")
  -s string
    	signal type
  -t string
    	workflow type
  -tq string
    	task queue (default "benchmark")
  -w	wait for workflows to complete (default true)
```

To use the runner in a Kubernetes cluster you could use:

```
kubectl run benchmark-runner --image ghcr.io/temporalio/benchmark-workers:main \
    --image-pull-policy Always \
    --env "TEMPORAL_GRPC_ENDPOINT=temporal-frontend.temporal:7233" \
    --env "TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE=default" \
    --command -- runner -t ExecuteActivity '{ "Count": 3, "Activity": "Echo", "Input": { "Message": "test" } }'
```

## Workflows

The worker provides the following workflows for you to use during benchmarking:

### ExecuteActivity

`ExecuteActivity({ Count: int, Activity: string, Input: interface{} })`

This workflow takes a count, an activity name and an activity input. The activity `Activity` will be run `Count` times with the given `input`. If the activity returns an error the workflow will fail with that error.

### ReceiveSignal

`ReceiveSignal()`

This workflow waits to receive a signal. It can be used with the runner's signal functionality to test signal-based workflows.

### DSLWorkflow

`DSLWorkflow([]DSLStep)`

This workflow takes an array of steps, each of which can execute an activity or a child workflow (which is another invocation of DSLWorkflow). This allows you to compose complex benchmarking scenarios, including nested and repeated activities and child workflows.

Each step can have the following fields:
- `a`: (string) Activity name to execute
- `i`: (object, optional) Input to pass to the activity
- `c`: (array of steps, optional) Child steps to execute as a child workflow
- `r`: (int, optional) Number of times to repeat this step (default 1)
- `p`: (int, optional) Size in bytes of padding data to add to activity inputs for increasing history size

#### Examples

This example runs the `Echo` activity 3 times, then starts a child workflow which also runs the `Echo` activity 3 times:

```
[
  {"a": "Echo", "i": {"Message": "test"}, "r": 3},
  {"c": [
    {"a": "Echo", "i": {"Message": "test"}, "r": 3}
  ]}
]
```

This example demonstrates using padding to increase history size by adding padding data to each activity:

```
[
  {"a": "Echo", "i": {"Message": "test"}, "p": 1024},
  {"a": "Sleep", "i": {"SleepTimeInSeconds": 1}, "p": 2048},
  {"c": [
    {"a": "Echo", "i": {"Message": "nested"}, "p": 512}
  ]}
]
```

You can start this workflow using `tctl` or any Temporal client, for example:

```
tctl workflow start --taskqueue benchmark --workflow_type DSLWorkflow --execution_timeout 60 -i '[{"a": "Echo", "i": {"Message": "test"}, "r": 3}, {"c": [{"a": "Echo", "i": {"Message": "test"}, "r": 3}]}]'
```

## Activities

The worker provides the following activities for you to use during benchmarking:

### Sleep

`Sleep({ SleepTimeInSeconds: int, Padding?: []byte })`

This activity sleeps for the given number of seconds. It never returns an error. This can be used to simulate activities which take a while to complete. The optional `Padding` field can be used to increase the size of the activity input in workflow history.

### Echo

`Echo({ Message: string, Padding?: []byte }) result`

This activity simply returns the message as it's result. This can be used for stress testing polling with activities that return instantly. The optional `Padding` field can be used to increase the size of the activity input in workflow history.
